# Comparison Table of KSP1 features to KSP2 features

Each feature is rated from 0-5 using the developers' feature system in each game

0. Does is exist?
1. Is it working?
2. Is it stable?
3. Is it performant?
4. Is it moddable?
5. Is it super awesome?

This table is sorted in order of development priority for features missing in KSP1. It includes KSP1 features for the purpose of comparison. Point 4 cannot really apply yet, although there is [Project Space Warp](https://github.com/X606/SpaceWarp), for now I will ignore it.
